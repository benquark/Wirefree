This library is used to control DIYSandbox Arduino-based WiFi products on both Arduino and chipKIT Uno32 and chipKIT Max32 (Max32 uses Serial1).  This version is experimental.
Current status:
Using serial output via Serial0 to identify where the code stops when using the Max32. Have not done any testing on the Arduino as yet. chipKIT not working yet either.
